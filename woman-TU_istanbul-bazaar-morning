Beautiful Istanbul! The smell of fresh baked goods, market vegetables, fish brought in that morning and a slightly bitter smell of gasoline wrap around the port city of Istanbul. 
A beguiling, young and graceful woman stands in the street in fron of a bazaar in Istanbul. The woman wears long, dark hair which cascade around her classic Mediterranean and Turkish features; the high cheekbones, the proud chin, thick lips and light eyes. Her eyes are light green, almost a grey, and her eyes indicate a strong sense of humor and intelligence. She wears glasses and a necklace, giving her a classic Turkish look, but she is still modern and cosmopolitan and urbane. 
Above, the sky is blue, it is a clear morning of sunlight. The rich scents of cardamom, Middle Eastern saffron, meatball spices, fermented flour, and curry powders and curry balls, curry sounds all drift along with the sounds to create an exciting yet relaxing ambiance that is as ancient as it is complicated. 35mm film, Olympus OM-1 camera using SLR shutter speed of 600, Zuiko 500mm
