The scent of freshly baked croissants wafts through the air as a gorgeous French woman stands on the grey streets of 1980s Paris. It's early morning at approximately 7am, and the woman is wearing a tight black turtleneck sweater under a long grey wool coat. Her short skirt and boots complete the chic ensemble. She glances to the side of the camera with a sense of happiness and amusement, standing in front of a quaint caf√© where locals sip their morning coffee. The Paris Metro rumbles nearby, and the colorful storefronts of patisseries and little grocery stores line the street. The early morning sun casts long shadows on the cobbled street, and the sky reflects a wide spectrum of colors in the clouds and ambient air. It's a clear and cool morning, with a crispness to the air that signals the start of a new adventure. 35mm film, Olympus OM-1 camera using SLR shutter speed of 800, Zuiko 500mm --no hats --v 5 --chaos 10 --quality 1 --stylize 800 --seed 1
