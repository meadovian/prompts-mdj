Downtown Seattle, 2073. An African-American man is sitting on the edge of a city, looking at the sludge and other debris. 
The man is looking at a sinking, flooded, broken street bridges across the park. He is wearing ragged frayed overalls made from old tires. The polluted shopping center is flooded, roads and bridges are broken with pea-green, polluted waters and piles of trash. 
It is morningtime and the low sun is shrouded behind infernal clouds stretching endlessly in a glaucus sage green sky. An uncanny chill pervades the still and heavy air, rank with deathly stench. The temperate zone is a pea-green bog, seething with plastic detritus, piles of trash, clogging the Stygian riverbanks. What once teemed with life is a swampy graveyard, ravaged by climate change. The region is sunk in a malaise of green fog in a rotting wasteland.
