The abandoned car in Phoenix, Arizona has been boiled into a metallic oil by the fevers of the setting sun. 
The silhouettes of Phoenix's downtown and hills can be seen since the car is abandoned near an organ cactus in a dumpster-style sandpit. 
Light refracts through the dusty windows and the photographic lensflare appears next to it. 
The car is just another abandoned tool, one more useless piece of metal passively absorbing the nuclear rays from the golden-white, eternal sun. 
The sky is a furnace of scorching heat while the parched earth is an unending series of sandstorms, thick dust and pollution. The contaminated water, withered and dying plants have terrified people to stay away.
