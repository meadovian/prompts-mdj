The great clipper at port, her rugged captain on deck. A striking, very handsome Greek man stands on the deck of a large clipper ship in the bustling port of Piraeus, just outside Athens in 1880. It is the late evening, and the sun is just dipping below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the harbor. The man is wearing a thick, black woolen sweater with nautical buttons, and his dark hair is swept back from his forehead. He is looking directly into the camera with a confident gaze, his piercing blue eyes reflecting the fading light. In the background, the sounds of the harbor can be heard - the creaking of ropes, the clanging of metal, and the distant chatter of sailors. The camera used is a 35mm Olympus OM-1, with an SLR shutter speed of 800, and a Zuiko 500mm lens. The image is slightly faded, light sepia. --no hats lens --v 5 --quality 2 --stylize 800 --seed 1
