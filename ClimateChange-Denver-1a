	Across a Denver city park, under two very tall and very skeletal grey pine trees, an emaciated deer stops on the savannah to stare at you.
	The Former Continental regions of Colorado have undergone drastic transformations due to climate change and the fauna and flora are withering, wilting with these changes. The pine trees are barren and scorched with hot temperatures that make it difficult for large mammals to survive. The winds smell like brown smoke and tar, and the grey quartz rocks seem to smoulder in the sun, blown only hotter by the wind. 
	The sky above is a deep shade of aquamarine, white and dry at the horizon. And as the sun begins to set, the sky becomes awash with brilliant oranges, yellows, and pinks, a stunning spectacle that brings a brief reprieve from the heat. The skyline of Denver, dark blue near the mountains, is a silhouette on the horizon.
	A sole whitetail buck, emaciated with sunken eyes, nearing starvation, walks across the park and stops to stare at you. It's fur is mangy and scabs can be seen around the sides and hops. Its ears perked up to listen as it prepares to run.
