This photo of the Arctic landscape in 2073 shows the continued warming and melting of ice and permafrost due to the devastating effects of climate change. 
The sea ice cover has shrunk, leading to greater areas of open water and thinner ice. 
As the permafrost thaws, areas of tundra are more suitable for trees and shrubs. The Siberian larch, among other trees, survives despite the hot conditions. The melting sea ice has had significant impacts on the arctic animals that depend on it. They are hungry, starving even. 
The Arctic coastline shows Shoreline erosion, sa level rise and significant impacts on low-lying coastal areas, including increased flooding and loss of habitats. The sky may is cloudy due to increased moisture in the atmosphere. The colors of the Arctic sky are also changed as a result of changing atmospheric conditions. For example, warmer temperatures create dramatic displays of orange, pink, and purple hues.
