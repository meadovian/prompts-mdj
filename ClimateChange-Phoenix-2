Phoenix, Arizona is evacuated and baked by climate change, deserted and crisped to a golden desolation from the sun's heat. These remnants of a once-bustling city, towering skyscrapers and active highways, are now, in the year 2093, reduced to crumbling ruins, abandoned cars littering the streets, soaked in the eerie silence of a deserted city.
More like a zombie apocalypse than a furnace, the inhabitants are desperate, dangerous, and driven to madness by the heat and lack of resources.
The sky is a furnace of scorching heat while the parched earth is an unending series of sandstorms, thick dust and pollution. The contaminated water, withered and dying plants, occasional gusts of hot wind, stench of decay
only incites despair leaving little hope for humanity.
