Looking across the park, towards the sinking bridge near the polluted shopping center, you see a person standing, facing out, to your right. 
They are concerned and uneasy with their future. 
The Former Temperate Zone of what was a medium-sized city, now flooded with piles of small, plastic trash washed ashore on the riverbanks. 
What was once teeming with life has been devastated by the ravages of climate change. 
The region near 50ยบ latitude is now a rotting wasteland, where rising river levels have flooded cities and towns, leaving behind only remnants of a once-thriving civilization. As you journey through this desolate region, you notice that the people who have survived here have adapted to the new environment. People wear thick, waterproof clothing made of repurposed materials, designed to keep them warm and dry in the constant rain and bitter cold. 
Some have fashioned makeshift rain boots from old tires, while others wear waterproof hoods and gloves to protect themselves from the elements. As you look up at the sky, you see that it is a perpetual orange, filled with clouds that seem to stretch on forever. 
The sun is a distant memory, hidden behind the thick blanket of steamy moisture hanging over the land.
