	Four children sit outside of a bamboo-metal shack at sunset in a climate change with a neon sign and palm tree.
	In the style of maranao art, creative commons attribution, stockphoto, neo-concrete, sumatraism, the bechers' typologies, angular. 
	It is the year is 2093. In the oppressive heat and the harsh conditions the children are seated in the street next to a futuristic, ultramodern shack. The shack is a composite of bamboo and metal scrap.  One of the kids wears an electronic device. A palm tree arches over the dirt road. It is about to rain.
	The sky casts a hazy, orange patina over everything and the wind blows sour and humid. The sun casts comforting, tropical shadows.
