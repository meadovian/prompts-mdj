A striking, very handsome Italian man stands on the hilly streets of 1970s San Francisco at late sunset, approximately 7pm in the summer, wearing a thick, blue wool sweater. He leans against a lamp post and looks into the camera with a sense of confidence and curiosity. The sun is casting long shadows across the street. There are no artificial lights, and the sky reflects a broad array of colors in the clouds and in the ambient humidity. It is slightly overcast and cool. 35mm film, Olympus OM-1 camera using SLR shutter speed of 800, Zuiko 500mm --no hats --v 5 --quality 2 --stylize 800 --seed 1
